[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

**Exercise 2**   The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.
Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform?

Generate random numbers:
```python
import numpy as np
sample = np.random.random(1000)
```

Plotting the PMF:
```python
pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(sample, label='random variate')
thinkplot.Pmf(pmf, linewidth=0.1)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='random variate', ylabel='PMF')

```

Plotting the CDF
```python
cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(sample, label='random variate')
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf, linewidth=0.5)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='random variate',ylabel='CDF')
```

> The distribution is uniform
